# Humidor Humidity Sensor

This project builds a humidity sensor that will take readings every 30 seconds and post the data to an influxdb server for charting. In the event it can't connect to the network, get a successful reading from the DHT22 sensor, or connect to your influxdb server, the red LED will turn on. If no LED is lit then all is well.

## Getting Started

These instructions will provide you with the breadboard schematic, the sketch, and the changes within the sketch you will need to make.
It will NOT go into configuring grafana or influxdb as there are plenty instructions found with a simple google search. It also assumes you have a working IDE for your NodeMCU ESP8266. Instructions on how to configure your ESP can be located here:

http://www.instructables.com/id/Quick-Start-to-Nodemcu-ESP8266-on-Arduino-IDE/

### Prerequisites

You will need the following environement setup:

#### Software:
1.Grafana or other graphing utility

2.Influxdb

3.Arduino IDE (DHT,ESP8266WiFi, and WiFiClient libraries)

#### Hardware:

1.Nodemcu ESP8266 Dev board

2.DHT22 Temp and Humidity Sensor

#### Breadboard Schematic

### Configure Sketch

Download HumditySensor-test-http.ino and open with Arduino. These changes need to be made to the sketch based on your own environment.

#### Configure network information

```
const char* ssid     = "SSID"; ------- Change to your SSID
const char* password = "SECRET"; ------ Your PW
const char* host = "x.x.x.x"; ------ IP address of your influxdb server
```
#### Configure POST HTTP request

```
  String url = "/write?db=Custom";
  Serial.print("requesting URL: "); Serial.println(url);
  String body= "Humidity,location=Humidor value=" + String(h);
  client.print(String("POST ") + url + " HTTP/1.1\r\n" +
               "Host: " + host + "\r\n" +
               "User-Agent: ESP8266\r\n" +
               "Content-length: " + body.length() +"\r\n" 
               "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" +
               "Connection: close\r\n\r\n" +
               body
              );
```
```
  String url = "/write?db=Custom"; <----------- Change db= to the database you want to send the data to (db=mydb)
```
```
  String body= "Humidity,location=Humidor value=" + String(h); <------ You can change the name and the location of the dataset
```

Upload the sketch to your esp8266

When configured correctly you should see the following output in your console (ctrl-shift-M)

### Configure Grafana Metrics

Your graph should look like this:

"Humidity" and "Location" can be change to whatever you want when you configure the HTTP Post section of the sketch.
